I am once again using [fixed-price lots](https://www.ledger-cli.org/3.0/doc/ledger3.html#Fixing-Lot-Prices) to get [Ledger](https://www.ledger-cli.org) to do what I want 😅.

```text
2021/10/13 * Initial phone call
    Assets:Billed Work:Client
    Income:Billable Hours  -0.75 HOUR @ =$100.00  ; 45m and 0s
```

I'd love to use `45m @@ =$75.00` instead and get a much more ergonomic experience but Ledger just ignores the price fixing if I do that 🤷‍♀️.
